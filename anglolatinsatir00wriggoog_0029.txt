In support of this advice, hebenus tells a story of two &fimum ”⁰¹5

who was impatient, boldly cut off her tail, end escaped
without it. Brunstta was less hasty ; and, ιι she waited
with patience, in a very short space of time the weather
changed, and a soft breeae set in, which melted the ιιι ;

finding him deuf to his advice, hc finishes by giving him
ι receipt to make his ιιι] grow longer. To prepare this
receipt it was necessary first tc obtain the ingrediente,
and this could only be done ιι Salernum, the great
medical school of the middleo ages.
