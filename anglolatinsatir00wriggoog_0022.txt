The AEnigmata of Symposius were undoubtedly popu·
lar among the An glo Saron scholare at an early period,
and formed no doubt the first model followed by the

English writers of Latin epigrams. Of these wo have

00013000 moro than one. At the head of the Anglo· Latin poets
{flffld‘ of the Saron period, stands the name of Aldhelm, who
was so intimately connected with the early history of
the tabbey of Malmesbury, and who after his dea th was
canonized and enrolled among the list of Anglo-Saxon
’ saints. Aldhelm was born apparently about the year
mammatae a writer ho belongs to the latter half of
tho seventh century He 1s the first of the Anglo· -Latin
Animi- epigramma tists with whom we are acquainted, and ho
{mim confessos that he was an imitator of Symposiue, who
was evidently at that timo a favourite poet. He was
nearly related m blood to the family of the WestSaxon
kings, end mado himself remarkable not only for tho
· depth, but for the eleganoe of his learning. When the
abbey of Malmesbury was founded, in 675 or 680, accord·
ing to different accounts, Aldhelm was appointed its
first abbot, and he hold this dignity until his death
00 the reeh of May 709. The AEnigmata stand almost
at the head of Aldhelm’s Latin poetry, and are printed
mun moy sin his works. Aldhelm, like many of the Anglo· Saxon
hfsffl imitatore of the Latin writers, is more affected and
elaborate than his model, and wants his simplicity of
sentiment and expression, but his AEnigmata are osten
extremely interesting as contributing to our intimate
knowledge of the social history and condition of the
time. 'l'hey are on this account well worthy of tho

study of the antiquary end historian.
