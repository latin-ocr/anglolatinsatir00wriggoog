scholare. Among these was 011 Euat-Anglian ecclesiastic

on. named Henry, who appears to have received his first

literary aspiratione among the monks 01 Ramsey, and
who in 1110 early age was educated in the household 01
Robert Bloet‚ bishop 01 1111100111, from the year 1092 to
1122. Shortly before the death 01 bishop Bloet, Henry
was appointed arebdeacon of Huntingdon and Hertford·
011110, atter which time nothing appears to be known 01 ,
his personal history. He is believed to have died soon

,⁸¹² ,⁹⁸ after1154. Heury 01 Huntingdou is known. as one 01
¹¹¹0, ”⁰⁸ the most valuable 01 0111 early national annalists. He

was the friend of Alexander, bishop 01 Lincolu, who died
in 1147, audit 1100 01 his desire that he wrote his
history 01 England, which was completed 111 001011 books,
ending with the death 01 king Henry I. His last
literary labour appears 10 have been to collect together ,
his writings into 0110 volume, which he divided into
twelve books, two copies 01 which book have been
preserved among the manuscripts 01 the Archiepiscopal
Library at Lambeth. The first seven books 01 this collec-
tion contain, the English history from the earliest period
to the death 01 Henry Ι. The history 01 the reign 01
king Stephon, which was written subsequently 10 tho
publication 01 the other seren, forms the eighth book
'l'he¹ ninth book contains some 01 Henry’s writings on
other historica] subjecte. The tenth book is 0 history
01 the English saints and their miracles, compiled from

11 ‘or Bede and other writers. The two remaining books were,
⁸' perhaps we may say, more personal in their character,

10111110 them he had collected the epigroms and other
minor poems which had exercised his youthsul genius
When editions 01 Henry of Huntingdon were given by

Savile and Wharton‚ they omitted the ports of his great
work which are not strictly 11101011001, aud printed only
the first eight books. I believe that I have edited here

101 the first time, that of his epigrama,¹ forming the
eleventh book 01 his history.
