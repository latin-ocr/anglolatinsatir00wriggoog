· were the work of Lactantius. There appears to be little
evidence of any account in favour of this latterthcory,

and perhaps even less for the supposition mentioned
before. Whoever was the composer of the Epigramsnxamples
which go under the name of symposius, they are simple ffimm·
and pure in their s‘tyle, and often terse and elegant

in their sentiment. They are all more or less ouriously
illustrative of the manners and feelings of'the time, and,

indeed, this constitutos their especial historica] value;

and they sometimes present us with early exemplos of , ·
well-known ideae which are found euricusly at other

times and in other places. Thus, in the early biographies

of the poet Homer, when asked by some fishermen what

he had caught—(he had been fishing for animals of a ·
different description), he puzzled them by his enigmatical

reply that all that he had caught he had thrown away,

and all thet he had not been able te catch, he had

carried with him. This identical idea forms tlie subject

of one of the AEnigmata of symposius, which is expressed

in the following words :-·

“Est nova nostrarum cunctis captura ferarum,
“Ut si quis capias, et tu tibi ferre recuses,
“Et quod non capias tecum tamen ipsa reportas.”

Many of these AEnigmata, aa already hinted, are in7
tenestingly illustrative of incidente in the manners and
sentimenta of those early times. The following, for
example, describes no doubt some favourite drink of the
time of the so·called Symposius, which was certainly
made of three different ingrediente, but what it really
was seems uncertain. It may have possibly been mead,
for a marginal gloss in the earliest manuscript of it
which we possess says, that the ingrediente were boney,
wine, and pepper.. The words of the original are :—

“ Tres olim fuimus qui nomine jungimur uno ;
“ Ex tribus est unus, tres et miscentur in uno 3

‘⁸ Quisque bonus per se, melior qui continet pmnesss’
