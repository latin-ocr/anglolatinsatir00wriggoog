a third1 says hc was of '“ Araville, beside Rouen.” The
name John de Eigham, which has else been given to
this poet, originated in the error of some person who

which the poem ol John de Hauteville was contained,
for that of the author.
· The hero of this poem is Architrenius‚ a name which
³³⁰⁸· means the arch-waeper, and he is introduced aa ¹lament-
ing perpetually over the miseries and vices of mankind.
It is in fact a remarkable satire on the manners of that
age, and itis dedicated to Walter de Cottauces who is
described es then exchangiug the bishopric of Lincoln
in England for the archbishopric of Rouen in Normandy,
which fixos the date of its composition to the years
1184, or the latter pert of the reign of our Hemy IL
Several allusions in this poem would lead us to believe
thatits author hed passed a part of his life in England,
- but there appears to be no evidence of the truth of the
assertione of his older biographers that John de Haute- =
ville was educated in this island, or that he was a monk
of St. Alban's. ,

versification sometimes approach purity and eleganoe,
opens with some general observatione on the vice of sloth,
and others which more immediately arise out of it, from

walterae which the writer tuns suddenly to eddress Walter de

mmm Gottances on his promotior from the see of Lincoln to
that of Roucn, and speaks of that prolate in very high
terme. '
