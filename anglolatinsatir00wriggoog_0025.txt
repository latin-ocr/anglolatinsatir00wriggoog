nearly to the purity of Martial whom he professed to
imitate. They are written in elegiae verse, and ar-
ranged, as was the common practice with these medicval
Epigrammatists, in several series of epigrama consisting
of two lines, of four lines, of six, and of eight or ten,
with a few attha end of a larger number. Some of the
latter are especially interesting as relating to historical ,
personages os the time. Godfrey is said to have been aAnativeot ·
native oi Gambray, but the circumstances under which cambray.
he came into England appear not to be known. It is
only known that, when Simon, prior of Su Swithin's, at
Winchester, died in1082‚ Godirey was elected in his
place, and that he retained this office during the twenty-
five following years, at the end of which period he died.

. here for the first time, have been preserved in three
manuscripts, all written in the tweltth century, the
best of them (which I have marked A.) in a MS. in
the Cottonian Library (MS. Cotton. Vitellius A. xii),
the others in manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, B.
(MS. Digby, No. 65) and Ο. (MS. Digby, No. 112).
They are evident attempta to imitate the epigrama of .
Martial, but their general literary character is much
superior to what we might expect, and their interestis
greatly increased by the circumstance that a certain
number of them are devoted to persons of great his-
torical importance who lived in Godfrey’s time, such
as king Onnt, queen Emma, queen Edith, king William
(the Conqueror), queen Matilds, archbishop Lanfranc,
Wnlcher bishop of Durham, and others. I have in·
serted in the present collection, after the epigrama of
Godfrey of winchester, a few miscellaneous epigrams
from the same manuscripts, the authors of which arc
uncertain.

The teste for epigrama appears to have risen to a great
height in the earlier part of the tweltth century, and
their composition became a favorite practice of the young
