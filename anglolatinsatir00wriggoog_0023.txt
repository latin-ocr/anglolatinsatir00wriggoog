of his personal history, except-that ho died in 734, so
that he did noh enjoy long bhc archiepiscopal dignity.
Tabwine and Aldhclm adopted the same method oi
handing down io posberihy bhe exacb exhenb of their
works. The labier, as will be scen, prefaced his AEnig-
maia by an introduction which is composed in acrosbic
verses, in which ib will he observed thas, if we lake in

their consequibive order the first or lasb letters of each
linc, we get bhe line,

“ Aldhclmus cecinit millenis versibus odas,”

as indicabing bhc number of linceos which Aldhelm's col-
lection of AEnigmaba consisbcd. And, similarly, Tabwine
concludes his AEnigmaia with four lines direcling his
reader to lake in the same manner bhe' first lebber of Ι
each AEnigma in order bill he come bo ihc end, and then
returning back lake the lsai labier cf each firsb line,
wherehy we shall obbain bhe following couplet r·—

“ Sub dono quater haee diverse aenigmaba torquens

The AEnigma wass in many respacis only a variabion .
of tho Epigram,'bub it seems bo have been more congenial
bo ihe Anglo-Saxon haste with the enbry of hhe N or-
mans, however, the Epigram began bo take its place.
'lhe N ormans, perhaps, because bhcy spoke a Latin dia·
lech, seem io have had a keener appreciabion of ihe
Latin classic poebry than ihc Anglo·Saxons themselves,
and bhe siudy of Rornanlit teraturc was pursued aster the

Ι Norman conquesi,b wilh perhaps, more earnesbnass and
