XX INTRODUOTION.

seems to have been rather widely known for his poetical
talents. Contemporary with him lived a Latin poet
Jonnae named John de Hautevillc, of whose persoual history
flmtevine nothing is known, but he also is supposed to have
enjoyed the favour of Walter de Ooiltances, bishop of

ΕΙ] aud afterwards archbishop of Rouen.
Nigellus and J ohu de Hauteville were the authors of
the most remarkable satiras of the twelfth century, the
The Speculum Stultorum (or Mirror of Fools), and the poem
{ffifflffin of Architrenius. We have not much persoual informa·
¹ tion relating' to the history of either of these writers.
' Nigelius appears td have been oue of the men of rising
talant taken into the favour oi William de Longchamp,
bishop of Ely, and to him he addresses his great satiric
poem the Speculum Stultorum, which is, as its title
would lead us to suppose, an exposure of the follies of
the age, and itis directed especially against the scholare
and ecclesiastice, and against the corruptions of the
monastic orders. In this manner N igellus throws great

light on the character aud history of the medieval

¹ waliam schools and universities aud of medieval learning. He

{mte- addresses this book, as it is believed, to bishop William,

in the Prologus and in the opening lines :—
“ Suscipe pauca tibi veteris, Willelme, Nigelli
‘⁴ Scripta, minus sapido nuper arata stylo:
“ Hoc modicum novitatis opus tibi mitto legendum,
‘⁴ Maxima pars animae dimidiumque meae.’'

It must be remarked, however, that some doubt has
been thrown upon this appropriation of the name of
William, because in the prose Prologue to the poem this
William is not addressed as an ecclesiastic of raulr.
Burnellue This great poem of Nigellus has something peculiar
mem. in the character of its satire. Its hero is an ass, named
Burnellus or Brunellus,¹ who, we are told in the prose
