As we pursue the study of history with greater care and {gisl ff
deeper thought, the field of historical record becomes docffit,
wider and more varied in its character. In primitive
ages it was sufficient to preserve in memory some oi the
more important events of past times, and to know with
tolerable exactness the order in which they occurred.
Accuracy was not thought of, for history was romanos. At
a later period, when society had become more refined‚ and
written records were introduced, these records of historical
occurrences became chronicles, were written upon some
durable material, and were thus preserved for the use
of the public. The place in which they were deposited
was, usually, a temple, where they were under the care
of the priests, or, in Christian countries, a monastery.
At first they were still taken down from people's memo-
ries, and of course would not be very correct. The priest‚
cr monk, who had the record in his particular keeping
soon begcn' to learn the need of accuracy, and no doubt
in many ceses tried to obtain as conset a chronicis as he
could. (lut of this feeling of the want of correctness
arose another practice. Some member of the monastic
house took upon himself the duty of putting in writing
short accounts of events at the time they occurred, and
this duty was continued after him by others; and thus
came into existence chronicles which were contemporary,
and which could thus he dapendcd upon for the general
accuracy of their statements, and especially for dates
These chronicles, it need hardly be remarked, are among
the most valuable of our early historical records.
